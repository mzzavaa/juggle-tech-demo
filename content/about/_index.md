# About JuggleTech Dashboard

JuggleTech is an open-source **learning dashboard** created by AWS Heroes **Linda Mohamed** and **Nana Janashia** from Austria. The project combines technical learning with real-world project building, using juggling as a metaphor for skill acquisition.

## The Juggling Metaphor

Just as juggling requires practice, patience, and progressive skill building, so does learning new technologies. JuggleTech uses this metaphor to make the learning journey more engaging:

- **One Ball** modules focus on mastering a single concept
- **Two Ball** modules introduce coordination between multiple components
- **Three Ball** modules orchestrate complex systems working together
- Different **props** (balls, rings, clubs) represent different types of skills

## Learning Philosophy

JuggleTech is built on three core principles:

1. **Technical Skills** - Learn practical, hands-on technical capabilities
2. **Real-World Use Cases** - Apply skills to build actual projects (like OTTO, our AI assistant)
3. **Business Validation** - Understand the ROI and business value of what you're building

This three-pronged approach ensures you don't just learn how to code, but also how to identify problems worth solving and how to measure success.

## How to Use JuggleTech

1. **Dashboard** - Get an overview of your progress
2. **Modules** - Work through learning modules at your own pace
3. **Practice** - Track your "juggling practice" (hands-on coding sessions)
4. **Achievements** - Unlock achievements as you complete modules
5. **News** - Stay updated with relevant tech news and insights

## Fork and Customize

JuggleTech is designed to be forked and customized for your own learning journey:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Update your GitHub username in the configuration
3. Customize modules and achievements to match your learning goals
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages with the included workflow
